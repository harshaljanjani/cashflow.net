1) eliminate read phenomena (phantom read, serialization anomaly, dirty read, non-repeatable read)
2) implement one of the four isolation levels defined by ANSI (depending on the db, low to high levels of isolation)
    a) lowest: read-uncommited (allows dirty read)
    b) medium: read-commited (no dirty read)
    c) high: repeatable-read (same search query returns same result)
    d) very high: serializable (concurrent transactions behave as if they are executed sequentially, and without overlapping)
